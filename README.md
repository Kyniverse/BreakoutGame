# BreakoutGame
This is a version of "Breakout" by Atari written by Kenneth van den Berg within C# 7.0 and Monoga.e. This game features
content which is all internally generated. No external resources as used.

## Why create a re-make?
Why not? The purpose of this project was to see if I could do a proper remake of the game with the knowledge that I have 
collected over the years.

## Syntax and other rules.
The project has been written in C# 7.0 in a syntax form regarding the 'Microsoft Stylecop Rule SA1201'
